## Features

- Connect Claude Desktop AI to your Google account
- Retrieve calendar lists and events
- Create, update, and delete events
- Automatic Token management


## Requirements

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Google account with Calendar access
- Google OAuth2 credentials (for Cloud OAuth method)

## Getting Started
Since this is a local server, you'll need to set up google cloud project to use it. Here's a detailed guide on how to get your tokens.

### 1. Create new project
Access to the [google cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com), then create a new project.
### 2. Google Cloud OAuth
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Go to **APIs and Services** > **Credentials** tab > click on **Create new credentials**.
4. Select _OAuth Client ID_ as type of credential and _Web Application_ as application type. Then set a name for the credentials and add authorized redirect URIs as shown below:

Once finished, you should see the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RossiFire/mcp-google-calendar
cd mcp-google-calendar
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit the `.env` file with your configuration:

```
CLIENT_ID=your_cliend_id
CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret

# This is random string rapresenting the secret for the express session. 
EXPRESS_SECRET=your_express_secret
```
## Claude configuration

### Prerequisites

1. You must have Claude Desktop installed on your computer
2. The Google Calendar MCP server must be running and accessible
3. Your version of Claude Desktop must support MCP connections

### Running the Server

You need to manually start the MCP server **before** asking Claude to connect to it. Claude Desktop will not run the server for you using npx or any other command.

Follow these steps to set up the integration:

1. **Start the MCP server:**
   ```bash
   # Development mode
   npm run dev
   
   # OR Production mode (after building)
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

2. **Authenticate with Google (first time only):**
   - For Google Cloud OAuth: Visit http://localhost:3000/mcp/auth/url in your browser and complete the authorization flow
   - For Direct Authentication: Use a tool like Postman or curl to send a POST request to http://localhost:3000/auth/direct with your credentials

### Direct Authentication Methods

This server supports two authentication methods with Google Calendar. Both can be used with the server API directly, even if Claude Desktop connection is not yet supported.

#### 1. Google Cloud OAuth (Recommended)

This is the more secure method using standard OAuth flow:

1. Visit http://localhost:3000/mcp/auth/url in your browser
2. Complete the Google authorization process
3. You'll be redirected back to the callback URL

#### 2. Direct Authentication

For development/testing without setting up Google Cloud:

```bash
# Using curl
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/direct \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"your.email@gmail.com","password":"your_password"}'  

# Or with cookies
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/direct \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"cookies":"your_google_cookies"}'  
```

These methods allow you to test the server functionality directly, even if Claude Desktop connection is not yet supported.

### Configuring Claude Desktop Settings

Claude Desktop needs to be configured to recognize and access your MCP server:

1. **Locate your Claude Desktop settings file:**
   - On macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - On Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

2. **Add the MCP server configuration to the settings file:**
   - Open the settings.json file in a text editor
   - Find or create the `mcpServers` section
   - Add the following configuration (adjust as needed):


   ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "google-calendar": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["-y", "google-calendar-mcp"],
          "env": {
            "GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID": "<your-client-id>",
            "GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET": "<your-client-secret>",
            "GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI": "http://localhost:3000/auth/callback"
          },
          "description": "Google Calendar MCP server using npx"
        }
      }
    }
   ```

3. **Save the file and restart Claude Desktop**

Note: This method requires manual editing of configuration files and should be used with caution. Always backup the settings file before making changes.

### Verifying the Connection

- Ask Claude a simple calendar-related question like "What events do I have today?"
- If it responds with your calendar information, the connection is working

### Troubleshooting Claude Connection

If Claude cannot connect to your MCP server:

1. **Check Claude's response:** Claude will typically tell you if there's a problem with the connection

2. **Verify the server URL:** Make sure you've specified the correct URL including the /mcp path

3. **Check server logs:** Look at the console where your MCP server is running for any error messages

4. **Restart both applications:** Sometimes restarting both Claude Desktop and the MCP server can resolve connection issues

5. **Authentication status:** Ensure you've successfully authenticated with Google before trying to use the connection

6. **Contact Anthropic Support:** If you receive a message that Claude cannot connect to external servers, you may need to contact Anthropic support about MCP feature availability for your version of Claude Desktop

### Claude Commands Reference

Once connected, you can ask Claude to perform various calendar operations:

```
# View your schedule
What events do I have today?
What's on my calendar for next week?

## Docker Deployment

The project includes Docker configuration for easy deployment:

```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

## Security Considerations

- This MCP server stores authentication tokens locally in files. Make sure these files are secure and not committed to version control.
- In production environments, consider implementing more secure token storage methods.
- The server uses HTTPS by default in production mode for secure communication.
- Token refresh is handled automatically when tokens expire.

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

If you encounter authentication problems:

1. Make sure your credentials are correctly configured in the `.env` file
2. Check that the redirect URI matches exactly what is configured in Google Cloud Console (for Cloud OAuth)
3. Ensure the Google Calendar API is enabled in your Google Cloud project (for Cloud OAuth)
4. Try clearing the token files and re-authenticating

### Connection Issues

If Claude Desktop can't connect to the MCP server:

1. Verify the server is running and accessible at the specified URL
2. Check firewall settings to ensure the port is open
3. Make sure the server's port matches what Claude Desktop is trying to connect to

### Calendar Access Issues

If you're having trouble accessing calendars or events:

1. Ensure you've granted the necessary permissions during the authentication flow
2. Check that your Google account has access to the calendars you're trying to view
3. Verify that the calendar IDs being used are correct
